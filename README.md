<p id="description">This project takes place within our M2 Long Project UE where two groups collaborate to form a unique project. A SIAME team composed of 5 students will be responsible for the hardware and development of the robots while an RSD team formed of 2 students will handle communications between the robots and the Raspberry Pi as well as monitoring. The project was proposed by Mohamed Benallal and Hugo Blaise to Mr. Hugues Cass√© and presents itself as a follow-up to the line-following robot project carried out in L3 by a part of the group.</p>
